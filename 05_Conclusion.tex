We proposed a solution to help NFV becoming a reality for modular HG, making a first step to a fully virtualized home environment as proposed by ETSI.
We implemented a vNF and we used it to bring major enhancements to the HG, thanks to our SvNF, a small but efficient OSGi bundle, collaborating with vNF deployed in operator PoPs.
Other network functions play a key role in virtualizing HG like NAT or DHCP and should also be investigated.
For that, we must solve different issues, more related to network performances than to computational power. 
Further work will investigate the benefits for the CP and SP in having such a SvNF+vNF approach, focusing on the search of a cost function permitting them to take the proper decisions for Caching \& Transcoding processing according to their deployed elements (PoPs, CDNs, ...), for instance. 
We will also consider alternative execution environments for the Gateway.
