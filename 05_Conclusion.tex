We proposed a solution to help NFV becoming a reality for modular HG, making a first step to a fully virtualized home environment as proposed by ETSI.
We implemented a vNF and we used it to bring major enhancements to the HG, thanks to a small but efficient OSGi bundle collaborating with vNF deploy in operator POPs.
We plan implem
Other network functions play a key role in virtualizing HG like NAT or DHCP and should also be investigated.
For that, we must solve different issues, more related to network performances than to computational power.
