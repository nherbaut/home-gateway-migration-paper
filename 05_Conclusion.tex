We proposed a solution to help NFV becoming a reality for modular HG, making a first step to a fully virtualized home environment as proposed by ETSI.
We implemented a vNF and we used it to bring major enhancements to the HG, thanks to a small but efficient OSGi bundle collaborating with vNF deploy in operator POPs.

For OSGi modules, security, service isolation and management aspects has not been studied thoroughly and should be investigated especially in a multi-tenant scenario.
Other network functions play a key role in vNF HG like NAT and should also be investigated.
For that, we must solve different issues, more related to network performances than to computational power.
