Given all the advantages brought by the virtualisation of the home environment, we should see a dramatic market swap  happening in the coming years.
Even if field studies are currently conducted\footnote{Telefónica and NEC win innovation award for virtualized home gateway trials: http://tinyurl.com/o8cl3bv}, tall of them exclusively focus on emerging markets.
For more mature markets, SPs balance those advantages with the necessity to dampen their past investments made on their current infrastructures.
Additionally, there is also a technological risk in building VHG infrastructure at scale, especially in a deflationary market where investments need to take opportunistic paths. 

Focusing on the introduction of \textit{new services} made possible by virtualisation techniques has the advantage of not being too disturbing for the current infrastructure, while paving the way for a future migration to a full fledge virtual environment. 
Our objective is to demonstrate that in the current infrastrusture, we can integrate NFV within the Home Gateways to deploy new services easily and to this end, we introduce the Surrogate vNF (SvNF) approach.

\subsection{The Surrogate vNF Concept}

Our approach resides in the proposal of an alternative migration path where vNFs collaborate with modular gateways in the short/mid-term, and thus technically preparing the long-term migration towards a fully NFV-based HG, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:migration}. We introduce the concept of \textit{Surrogate vNF} (SvNF) in  
A SvNF is an OSGi bundle that acts like a regular module from the HG standpoint, except that it delegates any significant operation to a vNF operating in a standard ETSI compliant Virtual Network Function architecture.

The key role played by the SvNF+vNF couple in the migration path is that the vNF part is used on both the OSGi modular gateway scenario and on the L2 bridge scenario, allowing gradual migration of SP current customers' equipement while securing investments of the vNF. 

SvNF modules leverage the existing OSGi lifecycle and resource provisionning mechanisms, while at the same time extending them also to network resources. SvNF modules are aware of SP access network capabilities to support vNFs, so they can be registered in the HG OSGi execution environment provided that they are supported by the underlying network.
As shown in ~Figure \ref{fig:osgisvnf}, we extend the semantics of OSGi lifecycle by adding the capability to depend on network resources as well. SvNF modules register themselves on the runtime environment only if any suitable vNF is available to them. The HG falls back to legacy mode and keeps using the native implementation of the service if the virtualized one is not available.

Using SvNF, SPs are able to push new services to every customers in an hybrid mode where some customers go 100\% virtualized ()where it makes sense), while the others still run their legacy home gateways

 
\subsection{Feasibility: application to video delivery}
\begin{figure*}

	\caption{ High Level Design of the SvNF+vNF proposed Solution for Content Distribution
    \label{fig:hld}
    }
\end{figure*}

To demonstrate the feasibility of a modular and NFV-ready HG, we realized a proof of concept (POC).
In order for this POC to be highly relevant, we had to consider the best possible Network Functions to be virtualised.
We could have focused on core functions such as DHCP or NAT, which are challenging to virtualize at scale. However, virtualizing them does not illustrate how \textit{new services and features} could be rolled out easily on the Home Gateway.

We thus decided to highlight the advantages of our proposal by deploying a new type of SvNF+vNF related to media delivery that improves the End-User's Quality of Experience related to video consumption and enhance network performances at the same time.
Such a function can be introduced into a modular OSGi HG and its execution as a vNF would definitely be worth investigating due to the heavy video processing tasks it involves.


The use case consists of an End User $u$ consuming media from his Set-Top Box, connected to his HG where the $\SVNF_{u}$ is running.
Video streams of a VOD or IPTV service are transferred from the content provider distribution network \(\mathit{CP}_{\mathit{network}}\) (which may or may not include Content Delivery Networks - CDNs) to the TV and across $\SVNF_{u}$.
Figure~\ref{fig:hld} depicts the design of the system and the use case steps. The figure presents the interactions between CP, SP and End-User for a classical video streaming use case.
In the original content distribution model, content is streamed from the content provider network to the End-User Home Gateway function \(\SVNF_{u}\).

Classic deployment scenario involves the use of Content Distribution Network (CDN) to offload the CP main server.
CDN nodes are often collocated with Internet Exchange Points (IXP) which present the advantage of being located relatively close to the End-User. Our use case, however, introduces an alternative model where the content is cached in a regional Point Of Presence (POP) managed by the SP (also called micro-data centers located at the edge of the network). The HG and the PoP both belong to the SP and the SvNF+vNF couple hence created is deployed in those two equipments owned by the same entity. This way, they can co-work together efficiently. In this "enhanced" content distribution model, content is streamed from a streaming vNF deployed in the regional POP to the End-User SvNFu, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:osgisvnf}.

The Caching and Transcoding Orchestrator  $\CEO$ maintains a list of provisioned regional POPs \(\POP=\{p_{i}\}\) that can handle cache requests. On each $p_{i}$ a set of Streaming vNFs serves content to End-Users.

The $\CEO$ also manages Home Gateways configuration. It pushes a set of rules \(R_{u}=\{r^{u}_{1},r^{u}_{2},...,r^{u}_{n}\}\) on the $\SVNF_{u}$. 
Those rules are used to filter requests and responses crossing $\SVNF_{u}$ in order to notify the $\CEO$ that a video has been requested.
It also pushes a list of cached resources available to $\SVNF_{u}$ through the POPS $C_{u}=\{c^{i,u}_{j} \}$ where $j$ is the identifier of the resource and $i$ the identifier of the POP $p_{i}$ from which it can be retrieved. In our usecase, resources consist of video files hosted on a Video on Demand Server, and streamed over HTTP.

The SvNF module deployed on the HG works as a HTTP proxy.
When it receives a request from a client or a response from a server, it analyses it using the set of rules \(R_{u}\) and the set of cached resource $C_{u}$ deployed on the HG.
Depending on the result three possible scenarios can occur:

%\paragraph{Step1}EU requests the content from the vNF-Capable Gateway. 
%\paragraph{Step 2}
%The vNF-Capable Gateway analyses the video format, and checks it is technically compatible with the system (e.g. a supported video codec and supported delivery method).
%If it is compatible, we continue to scenario 2, otherwise, we proceed with scenario 1.

\subsubsection*{Scenario 1: no operation scenario}\label{noop}

In this scenario, the content consumed by the user is not eligible to the enhancements brought by the system. None of the rules $r_{i}$ deployed on $\SVNF_{u}$ matches the request or the response and the content does not match any $c^{i,u}_{j}$ either. We note $\mathbb{1}_{r_{i}}(.)$ and $\mathbb{1}_{c^{i,u}_{j}}(.)$ such that:
\[
    \mathbb{1 }_{r_{i}}(\mathit{message})= 
\begin{dcases}
    1& \text{if rule $r_{i}$ matches the message} \\
    0              & \text{otherwise}
\end{dcases}
\]
and 
\[
    \mathbb{1 }_{c^{i,u}_{j}}(\mathit{resource})= 
\begin{dcases}
    1& \text{if rule $c^{i,u}_{j}$ matches the resource} \\
    0              & \text{otherwise}
\end{dcases}
\]

After the Home Gateway has analysed the request, it is forwarded to its original destination.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	
\STATE User $u$ requests a resource
\STATE $\SVNF_{u}$ receives request $\mathit{Req}$ from $u$
\STATE \( \sum_{r^{u}_{i}\in R_{u}}{\mathbb{1}_{r_{i}}(\mathit{Req})}=0 \)
\STATE \( \sum_{c^{i,u}_{j}\in C_{u}}{\mathbb{1}_{c^{i,u}_{j}}(\mathit{Req})}=0 \)
\STATE $\SVNF_{u}$ forwards $\mathit{Req}$ to its original target \(\mathit{CP}_{\mathit{network}}\)
\STATE $\SVNF_{u}$ receives response $\mathit{Res}$ from \(\mathit{CP}_{\mathit{network}}\)
\STATE \( \sum_{r^{u}_{i}\in R_{u}}{\mathbb{1}_{r_{i}}(\mathit{Res})}=0 \)
\STATE User $u$ receives $\mathit{Res}$ from \(\mathit{CP}_{\mathit{network}}\) through $\SVNF_{u}$
\end{algorithmic}


The content is then directly consumed by the End-User from the Content Provider Delivery Network.
This is the common case, as it is performed today. The SvNF deployed on the HG does not bring any added value to the consumption of video streams, neither do the vNFs deployed in the SP system. It just lets the content pass through it.
In this case, the SvNF creates an overhead on the gateway without bringing additional value to the End-User.
This overhead is evaluated in ~Section \ref{Testbed} in order to know if it would penalize the user experience (and in which extent).

Before considering Scenario 2 and 3, where the SvNF+vNF couple is effectively used, we need to take a step back and describe the business aspects involved. At this point, we consider that the Content Provider contacted with the Service Provider to let its video content delivery being handled. On top of simply caching videos in POPs, vNFs have different techniques available to optimize End-User QoS, like reducing video bitrate, upgrading the video compression standard, using HTTP Adaptive Streaming and so on.

\subsubsection*{Scenario 2: Cache hit scenario}

In this scenario, some resources have been retrieved from \(\mathit{CP}_{\mathit{network}}\), transcoded and provisionned in a POP $p_{i}$ available to $\SVNF_{u}$.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\STATE User $u$ requests a resource
\STATE $\SVNF_{u}$ receives request $\mathit{Req}$ from $u$
\STATE \( \sum_{c^{i,u}_{j}\in C_{u}}{\mathbb{1}_{c^{i,u}_{j}}(\mathit{Req})}>0\)
\STATE $\SVNF_{u}$ forwards $\mathit{Req}$ to selected $p_{i}$
\STATE $\SVNF_{u}$ receives response $\mathit{Res}$ from $p_{i}$
\STATE User $u$ receives $\mathit{Res}$ from $p_{i}$ through $\SVNF_{u}$
\STATE $p_{i}$ notifies $\CEO$ that it served  $\mathit{Req}$
\end{algorithmic}


In this scenario, the content has been processed by the system and is made available in regional POPs which are part of the NVF infrastructure handling storage and content delivery.
They are managed by SP and can be collocated with existing operator-managed CDN.
vNFs are deployed in regional POPs and provisioned close to the user, limiting the number of hops with respect to the original Content Provider Network.
As the network becomes capable of handling both delivery and transcoding, required bandwidth and storage are reduced. The orchestrator uses just in time transcoding to generate a specific video quality needed at a specific POP without preliminary work and storage.
We simulated this scenario and detailed the results in ~Section\ref{videodelivery}.

\subsubsection*{Scenario 3: Cache miss scenario}

In this scenario, the resource targeted by the user matches the Rules, but it is not available.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE User $u$ requests a resource
\STATE $\SVNF_{u}$ receives request $\mathit{Req}$ from $u$
\STATE \( \sum_{c^{i,u}_{j}\in C_{u}}{\mathbb{1}_{c^{i,u}_{j}}(\mathit{Req})} = 0 \)
\STATE \( \sum_{r^{u}_{i}\in R_{u}}{\mathbb{1}_{r_{i}}(\mathit{Req})} > 0  \)
\IF { $M_{req}>0$}
\STATE $\SVNF_{u}$ informs $\CEO$ that $u$ requested $\mathit{Req}$
\ENDIF
\STATE $\SVNF_{u}$ forwards $\mathit{Req}$ to its original target \(\mathit{CP}_{\mathit{network}}\)
\STATE $\SVNF_{u}$ receives response $\mathit{Res}$ from \(\mathit{CP}_{\mathit{network}}\)
\IF { $M_{req} = 0$ }
	\STATE \( \sum_{r^{u}_{i}\in R_{u}}{\mathbb{1}_{r_{i}}(\mathit{Res})}=M_{res}\) 
	\IF { $M_{res} = 0$}
	\STATE $\SVNF_{u}$ informs $\CEO$ that $u$ received $\mathit{Res}$
	\ENDIF
\ENDIF

 
\STATE User $u$ receives $\mathit{Res}$ from \(\mathit{CP}_{\mathit{network}}\) through $\SVNF_{u}$
\end{algorithmic}

Here, $\CEO$ is informed that a cache request has not been fulfilled. According to its provisionning algorithm, it can decide to deploy the resource corresponding to $\mathit{Req}$ in a $p_{i}$ either by transcoding the original file from \(\mathit{CP}_{\mathit{network}}\) to a $p_{i}$ or by reprovisionning $c^{k,u}_{j}$ to $p_{i}$.
If a modification has been operated on the POPS, $\CEO$ will update the Home Gateway cache tables.

The Caching and Transcoding Orchestrator takes the decision to perform caching and transcoding on the content based on several criteria ranging from Context and User Intelligence (which has been proven in \cite{wang_cpcdn:_2015} to improve the performance of content delivery), to business negotiation between CP and SP.
However, this decision process is not in the scope of this paper and will be studied in further work. 
We simulated this third scenario and detailed the results in ~Section\ref{provisionningdecisions}.

%\subsection{In-network processing benefits for CP and SP}
%The NFV approach allows us to process data directly in the network.
%For our use case, it means that we can apply arbitrary modification to a video with a view to optimize the delivery with respect to a specific technical or business objective.
%For example, targeted ads can be added to the video by the SP with a view to increase profit, QOE can be increased by transcoding the content into a specific format which has this property.
%The fact that we are able to transform the content directly into the network is a big advantage in term of flexibility and convenience of administration for CP and SP.

%One other striking features of NFV is its ability to dynamically provision network functions according to simple business requirements expressed as Service Layer Agreements (SLA).
%To fine-tune orchestration policy of the system, Service Providers could set a target of 10Mps in the 7pm-10pm time slot for its user toward a specific VOD website.
%Once the vNF is configured with those targets, Caching and Transcoding Orchestrator has to do its best to respect the SLA by using NFV infrastructure metrics (CPU, IO, Memory) but also specific application metrics.
%Thanks to the key roles played by the HG, our solution offers the possibility to collect metrics at the user level and hence using a Collective Intelligence approach to optimize system operation according to SLA targets. 
%
%Collective intelligence data is collected thanks to caching requests emitted by vHG.
%The system gathers data which reflect video consumption patterns on a per-user basis, like user average bandwidth, hourly consumption patterns, and consumption habits.
%Let's imagine a particular user watch HBO's Game of Thrones every Sunday evening on his Ipad which support Apple's HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) on a T1 connection.
%If this pattern is widespread amongst users, the Caching and Transcoding Orchestrator can assign a higher priority on the transcoding of the HD HLS version of the popular TV show and assuring the correct provisionning on selected regional POPs.
%
%This approach allows CP to broadcast its content in cooperation with Service Providers NVF network with limited technical interaction.
%Indeed, expressing contractual SLA target is enough for the CP to deploy its content, as the Service Providers' vNF becomes responsible for determining (1) which content to cache (2) which enhancements to bring to the content and (3) where to cache the content.
