	abstract = {Cloud computing services delivery and consumption model is based on communication infrastructure (network). The network serves as a linkage between the end-users consuming cloud services and the providers of data centers providing the cloud services. In addition, in large-scale cloud data centers, tens of thousands of compute and storage nodes are connected by a data center network to deliver a single-purpose cloud service. To this end, some questions could be raised, such as the following: How do network architectures affect cloud computing? How will network architecture evolve to support better cloud computing and cloud-based service delivery? What is the network's role in reliability, performance, scalability, and security of cloud computing? Should the network be a dumb transport pipe or an intelligent stack that is cloud workload aware? This paper focuses on the networking aspect in cloud computing and shall provide insights to these questions. Researchers can use this paper to accelerate their research on devising mechanisms for the following: (i) provisioning cloud network as a service and (ii) engineering network of data centers.

It was confirmed that product development has impact on price decline and that there is a strong relationship between LCD panel production capability and LCD TV price decline. Considering these analysis results, it is believed that modularization and Japanese manufacturers' offshore production have led to global competition and production volume has increased due to active investment on LCD industry, which resulted in price competition and commoditization. In light of all this, there are some implications for Japanese manufacturers: First one is whether or not products can continually provide differentiated values and second is to implement adequate development strategies to internally retain product collaboration process technology.},

Home gateway is a popular equipment deployed at the end of networks and supporting a set of heterogeneous services (from network to multimedia services). These gateways are difficult to manage for network operators and consume a lot of energy. This paper explores the possibility to reduce the complexity of such equipment by moving services to some external dedicated and shared facilities. This paper will present first result towards virtualizing home gateway services towards some specific part of the network. When combined to quasi passive CPE, this approach can reduce the energy consumption of wired networks infrastructures.

	abstract = {To distribute video and audio data in real-time streaming mode, two different technologies – Content Distribution Network (CDN) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) – have been proposed. However, both technologies have their own limitations: CDN servers are expensive to deploy and maintain, and consequently incur a cost for media providers and/or clients for server capacity reservation. On the other hand, a P2P-based architecture requires sufficient number of seed supplying peers to jumpstart the distribution process. Compared with a CDN server, a peer usually offers much lower out-bound streaming rate and hence multiple peers must jointly stream a media data to a requesting peer. Furthermore, it is not clear how to determine how much a peer should contribute back to the system after receiving the media data, in order to sustain the overall media distribution capacity. In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel hybrid architecture that integrates both CDN- and P2P-based streaming media distribution. The architecture is highly cost-effective: it significantly lowers the cost of CDN capacity reservation, without compromising the media quality delivered. In particular, we propose and compare different limited contribution policies for peers that request a media data, so that the streaming capacity of each peer can be exploited on a fair and limited basis. We present: (1) in-depth analysis of the proposed architecture under different contribution policies, and (2) extensive simulation results which validate the analysis. Our analytical and simulation results form a rigorous basis for the planning and dimensioning of the hybrid architecture.},

This challenge can be faced either by boosting the capacity of the network infrastructure, or by means of offloading traffic from the backhaul and core network and serving contents from distributed cache servers close to the users. Network operators can extend the coverage of traditional CDNs by making usage of caching locations much closer to the users than traditional CDNs. Additionally, network operators can optimize the caching and delivery of contents by exploiting the complete knowledge of their network for designing a cost-effective infrastructure able to achieve both improved user satisfaction and cost savings. This article provides thoroughly justified design principles for a highly distributed operator-owned CDN while focusing on four key aspects: the optimal location of cache servers, mechanisms for request routing, content replica placement, and content outsourcing and retrieval.},

As a particular aspect of the conducted experiments, it turned out that the VP9 encoder produces an average bit-rate overhead of 8.4\% at the same objective quality, when compared to an open H.264/MPEG-AVC encoder implementation - the x264 encoder. On the other hand, the typical encoding times of the VP9 encoder are more than 100 times higher than those measured for the x264 encoder.

Starting from the core, the impact of these developments is reaching towards the edge of the infrastructure and into the access network. In this spirit, we foresee the opportunity of virtualizing a key device of modern broadband access networks: the Residential Gateway (RGW). Presently located on the customer premises, the RGW stands between the home network and the access network. It imposes a considerable cost for the operator (acquisition and operation) and constitutes a single point of failure for all the services offered to the residential customers - such as Internet access, VoIP, IPTV and Video-on-Demand. In this paper we propose an architecture for virtualized Residential Gateways (vRGWs) which physically removes the RGW from the customer premises, moving it into the operator data center as a virtualized entity. This solution potentially reduces deployment, maintenance and operation costs, whilst improving overall flexibility, reliability and manageability - both for the access network infrastructure and for provided services.},

By exploiting powerful CP-level information in content distribution, these CP-built CDNs open up a whole new design space and are changing the content delivery landscape. In this paper, we adopt a measurement-based approach to understanding why, how, and how much CP-level intelligences can help content delivery. We first present a measurement study of the CDN built by Tencent, a largest content provider based in China. We observe new characteristics and trends in content delivery which pose great challenges to the conventional content delivery paradigm and motivate the proposal of CPCDN, a CDN powered by CP-aware information. We then reveal the benefits obtained by exploiting two indispensable CP-level intelligences, namely context intelligence and user intelligence, in content delivery. Inspired by the insights learnt from the measurement studies, we systematically explore the design space of CPCDN and present the novel architecture and algorithms to address the new content delivery challenges that have arisen. Our results not only demonstrate the potential of CPCDN in pushing content delivery performance to the next level, but also identify new research problems calling for further investigation.},

Using as a basis one of the network functions offered by network routers, this article presents the analysis, design, and the first implementation, in a virtualized manner, of the routing function. Considering the current co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6 and the possibilities brought into the arena by OpenFlow-enabled infrastructures, the article describes the design of the virtualized routing protocol, enabling a simple management and avoiding signaling messages overhead in the control plane level, and the different scenarios considered to validate the virtualized function. In essence, the manuscript describes one of the first implementations of the functional NFV concept, through the virtualization of the routing function over an OpenFlow network. The different scenarios validated in the article are used to demonstrate the applicability of the NFV-powered implementation proposed into actual production environments.},

Considering these analysis results, it is believed that modularization and Japanese manufacturers' offshore production have led to global competition and production volume has increased due to active investment on LCD industry, which resulted in price competition and commoditization. In light of all this, there are some implications for Japanese manufacturers: First one is whether or not products can continually provide differentiated values and second is to implement adequate development strategies to internally retain product collaboration process technology.},

	abstract = {Emerging information-centric networking architectures drives a wider focus of content caching mechanisms. Most recent efforts have been attempting for server and user friendliness, i.e., reduction in content-server load and content-delivery time. Those solutions require the prior knowledge of cache state and content popularity exchanged among routers. Challenging tasks are pushed to routers since their explicit coordination is required. Instead of burdening routers, but still keeping the effectiveness of in-network caching, we move the explicit coordination task from routers to a cache orchestrator where the offline optimal caching policy is computed while leaving the simplest cache decision to the routers. By means of the network function virtualization, this paper proposes a cache orchestration lifecycle including three parts, i.e., name hit caching (NHC) policy, pending time history and network cache orchestration. By exploiting NHC policy, a router simply caches the content whose name matches its assigned content name set. Evaluation through simulations demonstrates that NHC policy achieves the lowest content-server load and content downloading time and the highest cache hit ratios in all routers comparing with leaving copy everywhere, probability caching and content-popularity-based cache orchestration policies.},

On the WAN side, new actors appear, such as multimedia content providers. From both sides emerge new features and new management needs. In this article we highlight challenges and benefits of moving more intelligence to the home gateway, making it more than a simple interconnection device. We argue that we need a full-fledged execution environment on gateways to address the evolution of business models. We present this evolution and summarize existing solutions for execution environments and management for home gateways. Then we propose two improvements that reflect the new requirements. The first improvement is a high-level virtualization of service gateways, and the second one recommends an end-to-end dynamic multiprovider management system.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel and fundamental change in the creation and delivery of media services like IP Television (IPTV) through the idea of the so-called virtual SetTop Box (vSTB). By shifting most of the service execution environment - e.g. the Web browser - to a Cloud infrastructure, the vSTB concept addresses certain limitations of current IPTV deployments. Nevertheless, routing UI delivery out of the Cloud causes a significant impact on the network infrastructure, which might have some implications for IPTV system response and can therefore result in a lower Quality of Experience overall. This paper describes this approach and its current implementation, as well as identifying and addressing network challenges that emerged in a corresponding project in the Telekom Innovation Laboratories. Furthermore, this paper provides a comparison between IPTV service executed locally on an end-user device (locally-rendered IPTV UI), and that delivered to an end-user after it was executed within the cloud (Cloud-rendered IPTV UI) and empirically shows the feasibility of the presented vSTB Approach.},

This new paradigm aims to diminish service providers' capital and operational expenditures in home equipment associated to the deployment of services for residential customers, while easing the deployment of new services due to the layer-2 visibility of the home network from the access network. Several architecture designs for this home routing gateway virtualization are presented together with a qualitative comparison among them. Finally, a list of topics for further study in order to make this paradigm a feasible deployment has been elaborated.},

	abstract = {Clicks is a new software architecture for building flexible and configurable routers. A Click router is assembled from packet processing modules called elements. Individual elements implement simple router functions like packet classification, queuing, scheduling, and interfacing with network devices. A router configurable is a directed graph with elements at the vertices; packets flow along the edges of the graph. Several features make individual elements more powerful and complex configurations easier to write, including pull connections, which model packet flow drivn by transmitting hardware devices, and flow-based router context, which helps an element locate other interesting elements. Click configurations are modular and easy to extend. A standards-compliant Click IP router has 16 elements on its forwarding path; some of its elements are also useful in Ethernet switches and IP tunnelling configurations. Extending the IP router to support dropping policies, fairness among flows, or Differentiated Services simply requires adding a couple of element at the right place. On conventional PC hardware, the Click IP router achieves a maximum loss-free forwarding rate of 333,000 64-byte packets per second, demonstrating that Click's modular and flexible architecture is compatible with good performance.},

Cloud Computing has emerged as a popular computing model to support processing large volumetric data using clusters of commodity computers. According to J.Dean and S. Ghemawat [1], Google currently processes over 20 terabytes of raw Web data. It's some fascinating, large-scale processing of data that makes your head spin and appreciate the years of distributed computing fine-tuning applied to today's large problems. The evolution of cloud computing can handle such massive data as per on demand service. Nowadays the computational world is opting for pay-for-use models and Hype and discussion aside, there remains no concrete definition of cloud computing. In this paper, we first develop a comprehensive taxonomy for describing cloud computing architecture. Then we use this taxonomy to survey several existing cloud computing services developed by various projects world-wide such as Google, force.com, Amazon. We use the taxonomy and survey results not only to identify similarities and differences of the architectural approaches of cloud computing, but also to identify areas requiring further research.},
